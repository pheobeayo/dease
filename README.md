# Dease
Product Overview:
Dease is a web3 developer tool designed to streamline the deployment of blockchain-based tokens. The platform enables developers to quickly create tokens by providing key inputs, deploy them on the blockchain, and access important token details such as contract addresses. Additionally, Dease offers a tracking mechanism to maintain a history of all deployed tokens, including their total supply and balance.

## About Dease
Dease simplifies the token creation process by providing a user-friendly platform where developers can:
- Connect their wallet and access the dashboard.
- Deploy tokens by inputting basic details such as the token name, symbol, and total supply.
- Easily access and copy the contract address for further use.
- Track the history of all deployed tokens along with their total supply and balance in one centralized dashboard.




### Why Dease?

Creating and managing blockchain-based tokens is often complex, requiring advanced technical skills and knowledge of smart contracts. This process can deter developers who lack extensive blockchain expertise. Furthermore, keeping track of multiple deployed tokens and their details can be cumbersome without an intuitive interface.


## Core Features
1. Wallet Integration:
Enable users to connect their cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect).
2. Token Deployment:
Input fields for:
- Token Name: The name of the token (e.g., "MyToken").
- Token Symbol: The token's symbol (e.g., "MTK").
- Token Decimals: The decimals of the token (e.g 18)
- Total Supply: The total number of tokens to be created.
- A "Deploy Token" button that triggers the smart contract deployment process.
Display a confirmation message with the contract address once the token is deployed.
3. Token Management Dashboard:
Overview of all deployed tokens:
- Token Name
- Token Symbol
- Token Decimals
- Total Supply
- Balance
- Contract Address (with a "Copy" button for easy access).
4. Token Deployment History:
- Maintain a chronological record of all tokens deployed by the user.
- Include timestamps and status updates (e.g., "Deployed Successfully").
